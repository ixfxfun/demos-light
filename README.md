# ixfx-demos-light

There are a few versions of the demo repository.

* [ixfx-demos](https://github.com/clinth/ixfx-demos) includes a copy of ixfx. This is useful for working offline and the recommended approach.
* [ixfx-demos-npm](https://github.com/clinth/ixfx-demos-npm) is meant for running in a hosted environment or using a Node.js build process (also allowing you to use Typescript)
* You are here: [ixfx-demos-light](https://github.com/clinth/ixfx-demos-light) is a lightweight version. It uses URL imports for code and is simple to host. This is essentially how the [Glitch version](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ixfx-demos) runs.

* [Demos can be run online](https://clinth.github.io/ixfx-demos/)
* [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/clinth/ixfx-demos/)
* If you find a bug in a demo, please [report it](https://github.com/ClintH/ixfx-demos/issues).

Good to know:

* [Type annotations](./_readmes/typing.md)
